# game-practice

>This is my first progeam written in python using pygame and time libraries.
>The goal of the game is to escape the incoming blocks as they get faster and bigger as the game progresses.

# How to play
>In order to successfully play the game please update PIP and install Pygame library. I am working on an executable version
>but until then this is the way to play.


# Future plan for the game

- Add a start menu / screen - Done
- Enable mouse control
- Set "you win" when reaching 20 dodged objects - Done
