# game-practice

>This is my first progeam written in python using pygame and time libraries.
>The goal of the game is to escape the incoming blocks as they get faster and bigger as the game progresses.

# Future plan for the game

- Add a start menu / screen
- Enable mouse control
- Set "you win" when reaching 20 dodged objects
